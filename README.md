# Fritzing Parts

This repository contains all part definitions that are shipped with the [Fritzing App](https://github.com/fritzing/fritzing-app).

Parts are composed of meta-data (.fzp) and related graphics (.svg). Depending on who created them, they reside in the core folder (the "official" selection), the contrib folder (shared community contributions), or the user folder (the user's own parts).
